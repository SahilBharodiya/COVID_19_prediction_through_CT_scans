# COVID_19_prediction_through_CT_scans
COVID pandemic is troubleful for everyone.
I made a Neural Network model that predict weather the person is COVID positive or COVID negative based on its chest CT scans.
You can download the training data from https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1xLPB0Q2kvL_WUO59G7_Todj7fEq_Pu7e?usp=sharing
These data have been collected from real patients in hospitals from Sao Paulo, Brazil. The aim of this dataset is to encourage the research and development of artificial intelligent methods which are able to identify if a person is infected by SARS-CoV-2 through the analysis of his/her CT scans.
Although code is given in both .ipynb and .py format but I suggest .ipynb to all enthusiasist.

I also tested this model on real data and it works pretty well
